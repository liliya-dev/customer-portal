            Drag and drop important client request emails into a Teams conversation
            to create a shared task. Eliminate the inevitable chaos that ensues with

            Once a task is created, team members can weigh in - ask questions, offer
            advice, and even transfer task ownership to another person on the team.
            When everyone participates in the discussion, clients get better answers,
            faster. All from the place where your team collaboration already
            happens... Microsoft Teams.
